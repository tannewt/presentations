# Python's Next Decade and Us

## Pitch
Let's brainstorm where Python will grow in the 2020s! Who will be using Python in 2030 and why? How will people use Python? Where will Python fit in the global computing community? What can we do to make our ideal Python over the next decade?

## Description
With the Python 2 sunset and the turn of the decade, now is a great time to consider the future of computing and Python's role within it. Only a tiny fraction of the world's population can develop software but two-thirds have access to a mobile device. How can we bring computing to those folks and what role can Python play?

* Introduction and why and how I got into Python: 4 minutes
* Discussion of computing trends: 7 minutes
  * Python is [#4 in use according to StackOverflow 2019 and #2 in most loved][1]! Does that matter?
  * NOPE! We shouldn't be in this to be number 1. We're all here because Python has empowered us to do something with computers.
  * Computers are one of the most important tools human kind has every created. Being able to *use* them is the most important thing. What language it is doesn't matter.
  * Out 7.6 billion people on Earth only an estimated [23.9 **million** (with an m) are developers][2]. That is 0.3% of the world's population.
  * [At the end of 2018 there were 5.1 billion people with mobile services][3].
  * List of things we can do with Python today: serve a webpage, process tons of data, learn to program, and make an led blink.
  * How many of those 5.1 billion phone users want to do these things?
  * What will this list look like a decade from now?
* Let's not be afraid of other languages. They are doing many interesting things that we can learn from. Plus we're all on the same side. 7 minutes
    * Rust's community and memory model.
    * Javascript's evolution and React's functional paradigms.
    * React's docs being translated.
    * React native actively slimming down it's core.
* What should we do? TLC 4 minutes
  * Teach. Help empower others by teaching them Python. There is no better way to discover the bumps and bruises taken when learning something new than to teach it to someone.
  * Listen to others about what they need from the computers they use everyday.
    * Think of someone you know who doesn't program. What tasks could they automate with computers? What would it take to use Python?
    * Help other's outside of your field who also use Python. Data scientists talk to web devs and vice versa.
  * Contribute! There is no such thing as too easy. Each little bump in the road can throw someone off.
    * Smooth over every bump that folks hit when learning Python even if it means writing docs or another programming language.
    * Computer languages are almost all English, do whatever it takes to bring computing to another's spoken language.
* Computing is a tool everyone deserves access to. Whether it's Python or not, it's something we should all work to bring to others. 3 minutes

## Notes
This talk's goal is to provide a counter-point to the fear based, black swan presentations. While they do make some of the same points, this talk aims to place Python at the leading edge of bringing computing to people rather trying to chase another programming language out of fear.

This is a new talk. I am one of the folks at the forefront of teaching new folks Python using an alternative implementation instead of CPython.
